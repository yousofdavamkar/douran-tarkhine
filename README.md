# Simple HTML/CSS/JS Website

This repository contains a static website built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It's intended as a small, lightweight site you can open locally or deploy to any static hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.).

## What this is

- A minimal static website scaffold using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- No build tools required (unless you add them).
- Good starting point for learning or quick prototypes.

## Repository structure (suggested)

The typical layout for this project is:

- `index.html` — main entry page
- `css/` — stylesheets (e.g., `styles.css`)
- `js/` — JavaScript files (e.g., `main.js`)
- `assets/` — images, fonts, icons
- `README.md` — this file

Adjust as needed for your project.

## How to run locally

You can open `index.html` directly in your browser, but some features (fetch requests, modules) may require serving over HTTP. Here are two quick options.

Using Python (works if Python is installed):

```powershell
# Serve current directory at http://localhost:8000
python -m http.server 8000
```

Using Node (serve via the `serve` package):

```powershell
# Install once globally (if you have npm)
npm install -g serve
# Serve current directory
serve -s . -l 5000
```

Then open the shown URL (e.g., http://localhost:8000 or http://localhost:5000) in your browser.

## Development notes and tips

- Keep styles modular: use a single `css/styles.css` or split by component.
- Use `defer` on script tags for non-blocking JS:

```html
<script src="js/main.js" defer></script>
```

- Use semantic HTML and accessible ARIA attributes where appropriate.
- For image optimization, prefer modern formats (WebP) and add width/height attributes to avoid layout shifts.

## Deployment

You can deploy this static site to many providers. A few simple options:

- GitHub Pages: push to a repo and enable Pages in the repo settings.
- Netlify / Vercel: connect your repo and deploy automatically on push.

No build step is required for plain HTML/CSS/JS. If you add a bundler (Webpack, Vite) update deployment settings accordingly.

## Accessibility & Performance

- Run Lighthouse (in Chrome DevTools) and address major accessibility and performance issues.
- Minify CSS/JS for production if your files grow large.
- Serve images at appropriate sizes and use responsive `srcset` when applicable.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-change`.
3. Commit and push your changes.
4. Open a pull request describing your change.

For small personal projects, add a short issue or PR; for larger changes, open an issue first.

## License

Add a license file (`LICENSE`) if you intend to make this project public. Common choices:

- MIT — permissive and simple
- Apache-2.0 — permissive with patent grants

If you want, I can add a `LICENSE` file for you.

## Next steps (optional)

- Add a tiny CI check (linting or HTML validation).
- Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` for open-source readiness.
- Add a simple smoke test using Playwright or a CSS/HTML linter.

---

If you'd like, I can also:

- scaffold `index.html`, `css/styles.css`, and `js/main.js` files,
- add a small development `package.json` with a `serve` script,
- or add a `LICENSE` file. Tell me which and I'll implement it.
